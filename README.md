## Overview
The goal of this research is to identify offensive and aggressive content related to religion on social media, helping to manage potential conflicts and improve online safety.
## Dataset
### The dataset consists of 3,051 Bangla texts collected from:
1. Facebook posts and comments
2. YouTube comments
3. Online news portals
### The data is labeled into four classes:
1. Hate Speech
2. Vandalism
3. Life Threatening
4. Aggressive
## Models
The following models were tested on the dataset:
### Traditional Machine Learning Models:
1. Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB)
2. Gradient Boosting (GB)
3. Random Forest (RF)
### Deep Learning Models:
1. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
2. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
### Transformer-based Models:
1. BanglaBERT
2. m-BERT
3. XLM-roBERTa
## Results
Among the models tested, transformer-based models performed the best, particularly XLM-roBERTa, which achieved an accuracy of 72% on the dataset.
